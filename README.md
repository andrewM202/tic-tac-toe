Partner project
- Goal: Make a functional tic-tac-toe game

Things to do for the JavaScript
-   <!-- Finished --> Add event listeners to each grid tile
  -   <!-- Finished --> On click, we want either an X or O to appear
  -   <!-- Finished --> How do we want the X's or O's to appear? Download SVGs or just make big font sized O's and X's?
  -   <!-- Finished --> Alternate between X or O on each click
  -  <!-- Partially Finished --> After a grid tile is clicked, it cannot be clicked again (maybe remove the event listener?)
-   <!-- Finished --> Way to randomly determine if X or O goes first (probably with math.random)
<!--finished-->- If board is filled, or if 3 in a row, stop the game
  <!--finished--> How to determine if 3 in a row? Do we want to hard code for each of the 8 possibilities, or some kind of function to scan the board?
  <!--finished-->- Print results from winner/draw beneath the grid somehow






Extra, optional things after the game is functional
- Reset button
- Responsive design
- If 3 in a row, draw a line between 3 consecutive X's or O's that won
