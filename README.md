Partner project
- Goal: Make a functional tic-tac-toe game

Things to do for the JavaScript
- Add event listeners to each grid tile
  - On click, we want either an X or O to appear
  - How do we want the X's or O's to appear? Download SVGs or just make big font sized O's and X's?
  - Alternate between X or O on each click
  - After a grid tile is clicked, it cannot be clicked again (maybe remove the event listener?)
- Way to randomly determine if X or O goes first (probably with math.random)
- If board is filled, or if 3 in a row, stop the game
  - How to determine if 3 in a row? Do we want to hard code for each of the 8 possibilities, or some kind of function to scan the board?
  - If 3 in a row, draw a line between 3 consecutive X's or O's that won






Extra, optional things after the game is functional
- Reset button
- Responsive design
